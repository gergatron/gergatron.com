I'm an aspiring software developer currently practicing my craft in
Wheeling, WV.

Huge fan of the [jamstack]. Right now I'm enjoying integrating that
with as many things as possible, here are some examples:

- [This site]
- [My CV]
- [Cheat Sheets]

More details in the [projects section].

### My personality

I find it hard to identify my traits, so instead I took the
[16Personalities] test, here are [my results].

## My interests

I try to get to the gym three times a week to weight lift, that took
up quite a bit of my time over the last 3 years or so. I have focused
on the compound lifts bench, press, squat and my favourite,
[deadlift]!
