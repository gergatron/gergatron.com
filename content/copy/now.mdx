### Work

Working as a Chemical Dependency Tech for [Miracles Happen], to help
people start to learn to live life without the use of drugs. I am a
person in long term recovery and got clean on 03-03-2017.

I have fallen in love with using [jamstack] to create things. I use
this site as a testing playground for [projects] and have a
professional site [Greg Ross] for documenting technical debt and
pushing sites to live production.

### Play

I enjoy doing audio production stuff in my home studio. Specifically
using [bitwig] as my main DAW for creative ideas. Also tinkering with
electronics. Currently making circuits for my own custom modular
synthesis rack to hopefully integrate back into bitwig's "[the grid]"
for fun.

I regularly practice yoga and meditation techniques.

Also lift weights.
